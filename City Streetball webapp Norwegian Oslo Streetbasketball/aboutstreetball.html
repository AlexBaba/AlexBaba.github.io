            <p>The outdoor season at outdoor parks around the city starts in the spring and lasts through the summer until the fall when the season is out. Pick-up basketball is open to anyone who wants to try playing ball at public courts and popular ballparks (open from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m.). Some public parks are outdoor meeting places and often popular with full packed court. Times for pickup ex. below:   </p>

            <p>  Half-court play <br /> <br /> 
			Fouls <br /> <br /> 
         Streetball rules vary widely from different court to court. Rules of what plays that are legal and illegal are decided by the word fouls (a foul in basketball). 
<br /><br /> 
			  <img src="images/Bakgrunner/pickupgames16.jpg" width="500px" height="250px"></img>

<br /><br /> 
No referees are employed, so all players of both teams usually go by the rule to “call your own foul”. When a player who believes he has been fouled, simply needs to call out “Foul!” in exact moment, and play will be stopped, with the ball awarded to the fouled player’s team on the top of court (free throws after foul are usually not awarded in streetball, also difference to organized indoor basketball). 
<br /> <br /> 
  <img src="images/Bakgrunner/pickupgames15.jpg" width="550px" height="310px"></img>
<br /><br /> In some cases of competitive and experienced streetball games are the continuous calling of fouls generally disfavored.  That can be because of the amount of pauses and protestations scenario against such a call in groups of players. About the seriousness of a particular game. <br /> 
<br /><br />
<img src="images/Bakgrunner/pickupgames17.jpg" width="300px" height="150px"></img>
<br /><br />
  Other violations in basketball which are usual include traveling, double-dribble, carrying, kicking, goaltending, and backcourt violation.
  
  <br /><br />
 <img src="images/Bakgrunner/pickupgames18.jpg" width="600px" height="390px"></img>
<br /><br />
  Structure of games
    <br />   	<br />		       			
At the beginning of the game and after each made basket, play begins at the top of the key. A "checking" system is used to ensure that both teams are ready to begin play. This involves the offensive player saying "check" while throwing the ball to his defender. The defender then makes sure his/her team is ready and then throws the ball back to begin play.
 <br />   	<br />	
 	<img src="images/Bakgrunner/pickupgames20.jpg" width="500px" height="250px"></img>
 <img src="images/Bakgrunner/pickupgames22.png" width="500px" height="250px"></img>

 
  <br />   	<br />	
 If the ball goes out of bounds during play, the ball can either be checked from out of bounds near where the ball went out or at the top of the key, depending on the rules established before the game.
  	  <br />   	<br />		<img src="images/Bakgrunner/pickupgames14.jpg" width="400px" height="200px"></img>
	<br />	

  <br />   	<br />	
  
  If the defending team gains possession of the ball, they must take the ball out to beyond the three-point line before they can score a basket. This does not need to be at the top of the key (one leg crossing the line is enough) and no checking is required. This is analogous to taking the ball to the other side of the court in a full-court game.

                <h1>Basketball Training Hints, and Secrets</h1>
                 <p>Effective basketball training is essential for all players.

Whether you're a young player still learning the game, a college athlete attempting to turn pro, or a coach looking to help out their team, you should always be on the search for new basketball training tips to improve your game.

Forward we want to share 37 important basketball training tips that will help you develop skills and elevate your game to the next level.</p>

                <h1 style="postition: relative; bottom: 180px;">1. Always Have a Workout Plan</h1>
                 <p>There is nothing more important than having a plan of what you want to accomplish every time you step in the gym or the streetcourt.
<br />
This requires that you've spent time evaluating your strengths and weaknesses and you understand what areas of your game you should be focusing on.
<br />
​What shooting drills do you want to use? 
​How many shots do you want to take? 
​Do you need to work on your ball handling? 
The answers to all these questions should be clear to anyone who looks at the workout you have planned for the day.
<br />
Players can list their workouts on an electronic device like their phone or iPad, or be 'old school' by using traditional printed out paper with a pen to track your results (which I prefer).
Having a plan will allow you to stick to a schedule and be efficient.
You know exactly what to do and you go in and do it.</p>

            <div class="content">
                 <h1 style="postition: relative; bottom: 180px;">2. Treat your workouts like appointments</h1>
                 <p>Similar to how people schedule doctors appointments and work commitments, players must be schedule their basketball training workouts too.

Because if you don't schedule them, they probably won't happen.

Schedule your basketball workouts into your calendar at the start of the week and then hold yourself accountable to going to them.
<br />
How many times have you planned on working out, but other things came up.


​You lose track of time while playing video games...<br />
And then by the time you look at the clock, it's too late to work out so you just forget about it and say "Oh well. I'll do it tomorrow".

This can't happen if you want to develop as a basketball player.
You have to make workouts a priority if you want to be successful.</p>

            <div class="content">
                 <h1 style="postition: relative; bottom: 210px;">3. Shooting is one of the important skills in the game</h1>
                 <p>Players must understand this.

When you're in the gym, a lot of your workout time must be spent developing your ability to shoot the basketball.

Every other skill is secondary to shooting.


To give yourself the best chance for success, focus on shooting.

Your goal should always be to become the best shooter to improve.


<br />
Your goal should be 1,500 made shots per week.
​Elite Shooter = 1,500 made shots per week
​Great Shooter = 1,000 made shots per week 
​Poor Shooter = 500 made shots per week 

<br />
Let’s be real about the numbers to see how much time 1,500 shots a week takes…
If player makes 1 game-shot every fifteen seconds (4 made shots per minute).<br />
Good - 500 made shots would take 125 minutes = 2 hours and 5 minutes.
Great - 1000 made shots would take 250 minutes = 4 hours and 10 minutes.<br />
Elite-1,500 made shots=6 hours,15 minutes.

               <h1 style="postition: relative; bottom: 210px;">4. Perfect your shooting technique</h1>
                 <p>It is important for all players to develop a fundamentally sound, consistent, and repeatable shot.

And the sooner a player can develop this, the better.
<br />
It's much faster and easier for players to improve when they're using correct shooting technique.
<br />
Here are the 10 steps for a player to follow: <br />
​ Shot preparation.
​ Hand placement on the ball.
 ​Balanced base.
​ Feet direction (the turn).
​ Consistent shot pocket.
​ Eyes on target.
​ Wrinkle the wrist.
​ Elbow under the basketball.
​ Balance hand.
​ Rhythm shot + follow through.

                 <h1 style="postition: relative; bottom: 180px;">Always train at a game speed</h1>
                 <p>One of the biggest mistakes a player can make during workouts is only putting in 50% effort when practicing.

Instead of sprinting around the court, they jog.

Instead of raising up on each shot, they barely leave the ground.

Being able to shoot casually and being able to shoot after running off a screen and then jumping up high into the air to avoid the defender blocking your shot are completely different skills.
 <br />

If you want to improve your in-game shooting, you need to be practicing game shots at game speed.</p>

                <h1 style="postition: relative; bottom: 180px;">Work on your shot fake</h1>
                 <p>The key points of a shot fake you need to remember:
 <br /> <br />
a. Stay low - If the defender jumps on the shot fake, the offensive player needs to be low to explode past them and attack the rim.
 <br /> <br />
b. Raise the basketball to eye level - Any higher and the offensive player will take too long to make the most of their advantage.
 <br /> <br />
c. Eyes on the rim - To really sell the shot fake, players need to look at the rim. Defenders will often watch the eyes of their opponent.
 <br /> <br />
Once the defender takes the bait, the offensive player can either take one dribble to the left or right and shoot or they can attack the hoop.
 <br />
Commit to working on your shot fake and improving it.​</p>

                 <h1 style="postition: relative; bottom: 180px;">Develop a variety of finishes at the rim</h1>
                 <p>Once you become a lethal outside shooter, opposition players are going to be forced to defend you closer to prevent the outside shot.

It will also be far more likely that they'll jump on your shot fakes.

This is when you need to attack the rim.
 
Being able to explode past your opponent and then finish at the rim with a variety of moves is crucial to be a complete scorer.
 <br /> 
Here are 7 finishing moves all players should be working on:
 <br /> <br />
​Regular layups (overhand) <br />
​Finger Roll (underhand) <br />
​Floaters <br />
​Off-foot layups (example: right foot jump, right foot shot) <br />
​Euro step <br />
​Reverse layups <br />
​Jump stop layups. </p>

               <h1 style="postition: relative; bottom: 180px;">Don't forget about defense</h1>
                 <p>LBecoming one of the best defenders on your team is a smart way for any player to stand out and increase their court time.

How many players really want to improve defensively?
 <br />
Not many.
 <br />
The best way to improve your one-on-one defense is to compete against a live opponent. Preferably someone better than you.

Here's what to focus on:
 <br />
​Staying down in defensive stance.  <br />
​One arm's length away from your opponent.  <br />
​Contain them. Don't allow them to get past.  <br />
​Force them into a difficult shot.  <br />
Very few players are committed enough to focus on defense - be different.</p>

            <div class="content">
               <h1 style="postition: relative; bottom: 210px;">Become a beast in the low post</h1>
                 <p>Being able to catch the basketball in the low post and the score with a variety of moves is a lost art in today's game.

<br />

It just doesn't happen much anymore.

Usually kids are too busy shooting off-balance three-pointers.

Just as players aren't practicing scoring in the low post, then players aren't learning how to defend the low post either...
<br />
This gives players who are willing to commit time to developing their post moves a big advantage over the competition.

Here are the post moves I recommend working on:

​Jump hook <br />
​Up and under <br />
​Drop step <br />
​Face up shot <br />
To be clear, all players (1 - 5) should be working on these low post moves. Not just the tall players who usually hang around the rim.
<br />
You never know who's going to have a mismatch against a smaller or weaker opponent. All players must be prepared to take advantage in the low post.</p>

            <h1 style="postition: relative; bottom: 180px;">Improve your level of fitness</h1>
                 <p>Another fantastic way to improve your basketball training is to incorporate conditioning (sprints, bodyweight exercises) into every workout.
<br />
This is important for several reasons, but the one we'll talk about now is the importance of improving your fitness.
<br />
Improving your level of fitness will dramatically improve every single area of your game.
<br />
You'll be less fatigued while shooting, you'll be able to sprint back harder on defense, free-throws will be easier, much better defense, etc.
<br />
It's difficult to be a great player when you're fatigued...
<br />
When players are tired, they make mistakes.
<br />
And a player who makes mistakes and poor decisions isn't the kind of player that coaches want on the court at the end of games.
<br />
Add conditioning to the workuots.</p>

                <h1 style="postition: relative; bottom: 220px;">Become Ambidexterous</h1>
                 <p>Apart from shooting, the best players are able to perform all basketball skills equally well with both hands.

​They can pass with left and right. <br />
​They can block with left and right. <br />
​They can dribble with left and right. <br />
​They can finish with left and right. <br />
I've watched many young players dominate the game with their preferred hand at a young age. Many are so dominant that they don't even bother working on their opposite hand.

And here's what happens:

When they get to the next level, defenses get smarter.

You'll often hear a coach yell out to 'force him left' which can effectively shut down the player because they don't have the left hand dribbling skills to attack that direction.

It's important to work on both hands so that players are able to take advantage of anything that the defense gives them.

                 <p>While dribbling is without a doubt the most overused skill in basketball, it is still important to spend time on developing.

This is true for players at all five positions -- not just the guards.

The last few years have shown us that having a tall player who can rebound at a high rate and then immediately push the basketball down the floor is invaluable to a team; so encourage everyone to improve!
 
There are several ways to improve your ball-handling:

1. Compete against live defenders:
<br />
 Whether it's 5-on-5 or 1-on-1, playing against live defenders is the best way to improve your ball-handling. 
The benefit of live competition is that it forces you to learn how to be creative and effective in game-like situations. 


2. Full-Court Dribbling:
<br />
 If you have a full court available to practice (or a driveway), you can use the entire floor to work on different dribbling moves:
​ Crossovers,
hesitation dribble, behind-the-back, & through-the-legs</p>
            </div>
        </div>
		
		
			 <div class="slide">
            <div class="content">
          <h1 style="postition: relative; bottom: 210px;">Play more 1-on-1</h1>
                 <p>Competing one-on-one is by far one of the best ways to improve your basketball ability.
<br />
This is especially true if you're competing against players who are currently better than you.
<br />
Offensively, players learn how to create shot opportunities for themselves and score using a variety of moves.
<br />
Defensively, players must learn how to play solid on-ball defense as there is no help defense to back them up if the offensive player gets past them.


You can vary the games more to start from different positions on the floor ex. 
<br />

​On the wing <br />

​In the corner <br />

​In the low post <br />

​From the elbow <br />

​Off a closeout
</p>

            <div class="content">
        <h1 style="postition: relative; bottom: 210px;">Consistency is key to long-term improvement</h1>
                 <p>If you really want to become a great basketball player, you have to commit to working on your game long-term.
<br />
It always amazes me how many kids I see start a basketball training routine full of excitement and looking towards achieving big goals... 
<br />
...but then they quit after 1 or 2 weeks because they haven't seen any significant results yet.
<br />
You will not see overnight improvements.
<br />
In fact, your rate of improvement will be so small that you probably won't even realise it at first.
<br />
But this doesn't mean improvement isn't happening...
<br />
After a few months of training, you'll be able to look back on your basketball training log and you'll realise just how far you've come and how much better you are now than before.
<br />
Small improvements add up remarkably quickly.</p>

            <p>Pickup Basketball has many Benefits. Pickup hoops with days of getting together at the local park to “run” are always popular and accessible. Summer streetball and city playing, the heartbeat of the game. Pickup Basketball Can Aid  Player Development
Pick Up basketball is necessary for a player’s development. Physically and mentally. Physically, a player needs to know where they stack up with their peers and with players who are older, stronger and better than them. The playground or local rec center is the best place to be able to do this. Also, when a serious player spends a lot of time working out in the weight room, putting up shots or working on their skills; a pick-up game is a safe place to strut their new stuff. The playground is the perfect place to show off what you’ve been working on. Because who cares if you mess up a little bit? There’s no coach to yank you for screwing up or anything like that. It’s just you and a bunch of other hoopers doing their thing. <br />
<img src="images/Bakgrunner/pickupgames13.jpg"></img>
<br />
Pick Up Basketball Aids Conditioning <br />
Also, pick-up is a nice way to stay in shape. Whether it’s during the season or not, whenever you can get a bit of a sweat in and run up and down a bit it is an excellent source of exercise. About the benefit of pickup basketball on the player's heart.  So far as the mental aspect of the game, pick-up basketball has a lot to offer. A pick-up game is a place where a player can easily build confidence. There’s generally not a ton of defense being played so scoring is easy. And nothing builds a players confidence more than seeing that ball go through the hoop. It doesn’t matter who it is against either. Many players report first testing gains in our basketball speed and agility program on the pickup basketball courts.  Plus, like I stated before, young players often get the chance to go against older guys and success there can go a long way for a player’s development.  Conversely, these older guys have the craftiness and tricks that many young players can learn from. Pick Up Basketball Increases The Fun Factor
			  <img src="images/Bakgrunner/pickupgames3.jpg"></img>
<br />
Pick Up basketball is a place where the game remains innocent. A blacktop court is a holy place. There is something magical about a game of pick-up. Or an entire day of pick-up for that matter. To just go out there with a couple of buddies and compete for bragging rights is so much fun. It doesn’t even have to be 5 on 5. It can be 4 on 4 or all the way down to 1 on 1. It can be a game of hunch or a game of 21. It can even be a game of HORSE. It doesn’t make a difference. Pick-up basketball is fun. And it will always remain good fun.
<br />
<img src="images/Bakgrunner/pickupgames10.jpg"></img>
<br />

Sure pickup basketball has it’s problems and characters, but we think there are real life lessons that can be learned in dealing with some of them without having refs around to “settle” everything.  Try to work hard and implement new skills while playing pickup basketball.  

These days the organized game is a lot about money, and politics, and pressure on kids to perform. The good thing about pick-up is that none of those things matter. The only thing that matters on the hoop court that particular day is whether or not you got game.  Remember to try and introduce your new skills on the pickup court, then practice, and then into your game. </p>

                        <p>A pickup basketball game is merely a group of players showing up at their gym or at a outdoor streetpark and organizing a game between recreational players looking for a game.An impromptu game with friends and strangers in a park or backyard lends itself to variety. Sometimes they don't even know one another but have a mutual desire to play a competitive game of basketball. It is not an organized league or part of any organized group…merely, players looking to play and joining with other likeminded athletes. Most of us agree that pickup basketball is about as good as it gets.</p>

		<p> Offseason Pickup Basketball Improves Your Game
All of the offseason drills in the world can’t replace the real thing. And while pickup basketball is not the same as organized ball, the right games can still go a long way towards honing your craft. Youth athletes can benefit from pickup basketball in the following ways:

Getting in their reps - shooting, dribbling, passing, and the fundamentals of basketball require incessant repetition to master. Summer pickup games are a great opportunity to get in quality repetitions without any time limit or other complicating factors.

Getting experience against varied opponents - youth athletes primarily only face competition within their same age range and general ability levels. Sometimes playing against bigger, stronger, and more talented players can be a benefit in the long run.

Staying in shape - even the most relaxed pickup game offers a great workout. Keeping a young basketball player’s cardiovascular endurance, strength, and flexibility at a high level year round is much easier than building it back up each fall.</p>
    
	  <img src="images/Bakgrunner/pickupgames.jpg"></img>


	<p> Using Pickup Basketball Games to Build Good Habits
Along those lines, coaches and parents should tell young players that pickup games are an opportunity to become better by building good habits. It is possible to have fun and use proper fundamentals at the same time. In fact, for those of us who are endlessly competitive, it is the only way to have a great time.

Many youth players are quick to pass and hesitant to shoot. Still others will take outside shots without driving to the basket. Pickup games are great opportunities to build real basketball skills and confidence in young athletes. 
<br />
<img src="images/Bakgrunner/pickupgames11.jpg"></img>
<img src="images/Bakgrunner/pickupgames9.jpg"></img>

<br />
Summer basketball offers a freedom and a fun factor which allows many ballers to come out of their shell.

Some players may also need to work on something specific to improve their game. For example, if a player is a great scorer but lacks in play creation, he or she can use pickup games as a blank canvas. This athlete can try to drive and dish, make skip passes, and other techniques they may have never tried before without risk of repercussion. </p>

<p> How to Choose the Right Pickup Game for You
So where should young athletes be playing? Many kids will have a neighborhood hoop down the street or a few blocks over. Yet this might not be the best opportunity for kids who are interested in bettering themselves at players. Young basketball players and their parents should consider the following:

Safety - we have not touched on this, but the sad fact is that some basketball courts are not as safe as others. Pick a spot where kids will be comfortable and away from any bad influences.
Level of play - for a skilled basketball player, finding competition can be a challenge. Look around the area and call up some teammates if necessary.
Age of players - as we touched on earlier, sometimes playing against the older kids can be great. Other times, it may be a detriment. A physical mismatch can lead to sloppy play and potentially even injury.
Fun factor - at the end of the day, kids should have fun playing basketball in the summer. If we are splitting hairs between playing with our friends and playing with kids who are a bit better, playing with friends might be the way to go. If a young player is playing basketball with the right attitude, they will improve.

                    <h1>Learn about the history of streetbasketball</h1>
                    <p>Streetball is passion. Though it is not always beautiful, one could easily call it streetart. It is a rough sport for tough men which does not allow much of weakness. Streetball means competition including embarassement and sometimes even humiliation of opponents. However, it is a basis for friendships because there is one basic ingredient that connects all players: the love for the game. 
					<br /><br />
					Without any referee the flow of the game completely relies on the respect and the communication between the players. As a matter of fact this established different rules on every court where spectacular tricks count more than accurately obeying the rules of basketball. Traveling is accepted if an opponent-embarassing move is the result. Streetball is a sport that involves every part of your body, even the mouth: If you master trashtalk you master the court. Distracting the counterpart and entertaining the crowd is as much important as the actual game. These various aspects made streetball such an attractive show as it is today. 
					<br /><br />
					From its beginnings in the 70´s in the big cities of the US untill today the rules haven´t changed much but it´s got more and more influence within the street cultures around the world. Having its roots in the famous Rucker Park in New York City, streetball stepped up to other courts and cities where it was not enough for the boys to play on the team in their highschool. 
					<br /><br />
					Having not many opportunities for spending their free time streetball was the only chance to emulate their big idols from the ABA and later the NBA. Rapidly the games attracted a steady audience celebrating the vicious tricks and ankle-breakers of their “court-stars”. 
					<br /><br />
					These players became local legends and got nicknames within the community like “the Destroyer”, “Helicopter” or “Pee Wee”. Even the famous Julius “Dr. J” Erving showed his talents at the Rucker Park tournament in 1971. Butch Purcell, who kept track of the stats at Rucker Park, said about him: “Man oh man! He was dunking on people like crazy. Back then the games were only held on the weekends, so that next week, the word was spreading like wildfire over the city. When we showed up that next week to play our game, the park was so packed that people couldn’t get in.” After having played for three years in the team of the University of Massachusetts and pulling off tremendous stats there, he was not quite known within the audience at Rucker Park. 
					<br /><br />
	                Nevertheless, Ernie Morris, a witness of the legendary encounter between Julius Erving and Joe Hammond claimed avidly: “I’ve seen so much great basketball in that park, but I’ve never seen anything like it since.” Thus, the legends around “Doc” laid the grounds for the incomparable success of streetball. 
					<br /><br />
					In the following decades it also got recognized by the dominating basketball brands like Nike and even induced brands like Kickz and AND1 to build their corporate identity on that specific form of basketball. This increasing interest by the economy was further promoted when Allen Iverson made it possible for a sheer streetballer from Philly to succeed in the NBA. 
					<br /><br />
					He was beloved by the whole generation of young streetballers and established the streetstyle within the NBA. Iverson´s popularity made it possible for Reebok who signed him to advertise the streetball culture and gain profit from it. Even today in the commercialized and digitalized environment of the NBA the biggest stars such as Kevin Durant or Kyrie Irving don´t hesitate to come out and demonstrate their skills on the court. One could argue that the pure streetball does not deserve this development because it lacks tradition and identity. 
					<br /><br />
					However, streetball is still played in its traditional form around the world and the main components sustained: When you dare to play streetball it strenghtens your credibility… even if you lose, you win the respect of everybody on the court.</p>

					<p>
					<br />
<br />
<br /> <br />
Streetball unites, is about aspiration to victory, team corporation, a healthy lifestyle beauty and about staginess. 
The game is played by real champions who are not doing it for the money and don't cry on every foul.

  <h1 style="position: relative; bottom: 40px;">Streetball is a lifestyle. Lessons is earned on the Asphalt.</h1>
  <p style="font-size: 19px; position: relative; bottom: 95px;"> Steetbasket is the great leveller. No matter what you look like or who you are, if you can show you can play you're going to get respect. Streetball dates back to America in the 50s and became popular because you could play it anywhere, anytime and it was free. It spread worldwide and across America popularised by attracting media coverage. One simple thing that you could do to earn other’s respect on the basketball court is that if you play clean, others will enjoy playing with you. Just learn the rules and play clean. To earn respect on the court, you have to prove to the other players that you deserve that respect. <br /> <br /> If you’re playing with competitive people and throwing up bricks, they’re not going to want you on their team next game. It also works vice versa; if you show them that you’re good enough to keep playing, then they’ll respect you more. Let your play speak for itself. Go hard on every single play. Leave it all out there. Help up the other team when they fall, but don’t be afraid to knock them down. Play clean, fair, and hard. You don’t have to be the best, but your effort, your hustle, that will speak volumes to your coach, your teammates, and your opponents.
 <br /> <br /> In streetball, most often, technical and high-speed qualities come out on top. The large role is played by technical skill of each certain player. Local tournaments and events are also held some times in summer offseason on city courts or street parks. It is really great because they give players an opportunity to showcase their skills outside the traditional channels of the basket game. In streetball you put everyone on an equal playing field. Streetball is about developing as a sport athlete. This game is the next level of the game evolving, and if you look at the NBA now, while it's definitely not streetball, there are many elements of streetball getting mixed up with the fundamentals of the game.

  <h1 style="position: relative; bottom: 30px;">Streetbasketball Is Life. Street Credit, Respect and that you got game is Earned. Take your skills to the street.</h1>
  <p style="font-size: 19px; position: relative; bottom: 55px;">Basketball is a game of the streets with street culture in the background including rap music, breakdancing and hip-hop.. It’s one of the rare sports that anyone can play—all you need is a hoop and the ball. Streetball is about flair, about winning at any cost and mind games. Unlike traditional basketball, streetball is self-governed, meaning the players call the fouls. If someone makes a call you have to respect it as a player, but, you know, you get some soft players who start calling weak fouls, and we'll accept it and give them the ball back, but we'll let them know that it's soft. 
<br /> <br />The opponents you play against will not going to give you anything easy. We come from the defence-first mentality. If you're going to beat us then you're going to have to earn it. Streetball is mostly played with two teams of three on a half court with one basket. That's the real streetball and the most fun to play. Anyone can show up and play. You can roll up from 10am on the day - either as a team or an individual - and enter the park or the street court. <br /> <br /> There's more room for individual creativity (than in regular basketball) and the showmanship comes through because a lot of it is about looking good and putting on a show.
The 2 types of streetbasket players are: There are those who want to look good, do tricks and have fun, and then there's the hardest ballers who really don't care how they look, they just want to win in serious competition in a competitive way.
